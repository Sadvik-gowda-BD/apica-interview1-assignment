Write an implementation of a FIFO queue called MyQueue that is thread safe and can be instantiated for a specific type at compile time (hint: Generics).


Queue implementation should have an add() and a remove() method.
Queue should throw an checked QueueEmptyException (you have to create this) if remove() is invoked on an empty queue.

Feel free to use any classes in the JDK you like.

Provide a JUnit test class with 3 test cases.
2 test cases using the queue with 2 different types, String and Integer. Test should perform at least one add() and one remove() invocation on the queue. 
1 test case verifying that the exception is thrown when remove is invoked on an empty queue.
